                                       ASKIA v1.0, the console FPS.

All the code is created bi MrGargoyle, but followed the javidx9's Console FPS in C++ tutorial.

HOW TO PLAY?
First go in the console's properties ans change the window's height to 40.
1)
In the selection menu, type 1 to play with the basic map, type 2 to load your own map, type 3 to go in the options and type 4 to exit the game.

2)
Press:
RIGHT - to turn right.
LEFT  - to turn left.
UP    - to go up

At the top you can see your position, the FPS and the map.

HOW CAN I LOAD A MAP?
First type 2.
Next put the filename (the extension can be any, but but here .map is used), the file's width and the file's height.
Now you can play in your map! :)
